Yet, the real world often serves up data generated by\nfar more diverse processes. Outcomes might be binary choices (to adopt or\nreject), rankings on an ordinal scale (like satisfaction surveys), or simple\ncounts (such as the number of subscribers). In this chapter, we embark on an\nexpedition beyond the comfortable confines of normality, charting the terrain of\nthese alternative data types and the specialized tools we need to analyze them.\n\n## Binary Outcomes: The Coin Flips of Data\n\nBinary outcomes are the coin flips of the data world – two sides, two\npossibilities. Think success/failure, yes/no, or the ever-important adopt/reject\ndecision. To model these, we turn to the trusty logistic regression. While\nlinear probability models are also used, logistic regression has the distinct\nadvantage of keeping our predictions bounded between the sensible limits of 0\nand 1.\n\nThis workhorse of a model is a type of generalized linear model, employing a\nlogit link function:\n\n$$\n\\text{BernoulliLogit}(y|\\theta) = \\text{Bernoulli}(y|\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\theta))\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\text{logit}^{-1}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta)}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ninv_logit <- function(theta) {\n  return(1 / (1 + exp(-theta)))\n}\n\nggplot2::ggplot() +\n  ggplot2::stat_function(fun = inv_logit) +\n  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n  ggplot2::xlim(-5, 5) +\n  ggplot2::xlab(expression(theta))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](beyond_normality_files/figure-pdf/inverse_logit-1.pdf){fig-align='center' fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo illustrate, let's cook up some fake data:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fake data\nN <- 2000\nK <- 2\nset.seed(1982)\nfake_data <- tibble::tibble(\n  x1 = rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1),\n  x2 = rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1),\n  treat = sample(\n    x = c(TRUE, FALSE), size = N, replace = TRUE,\n    prob = c(0.5, 0.5)\n  ),\n  r = runif(n = N, min = 0, max = 1)\n) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    p0 = inv_logit(theta = -3 + 0.1 * x1 + 0.25 * x2),\n    p1 = inv_logit(theta = -3 + 0.1 * x1 + 0.25 * x2 + 0.2),\n    y0 = dplyr::case_when(p0 > r ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0),\n    y1 = dplyr::case_when(p1 > r ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0),\n    y = dplyr::case_when(\n      treat ~ as.logical(y1),\n      TRUE ~ as.logical(y0)\n    )\n  )\ndplyr::glimpse(fake_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 2,000\nColumns: 9\n$ x1    <dbl> 0.685092067, -0.005550195, -0.777641329, 1.875702830, -0.3771291~\n$ x2    <dbl> -0.665502269, -1.256150229, -0.230714338, 0.743955915, -0.630752~\n$ treat <lgl> FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE,~\n$ r     <dbl> 0.45401970, 0.20720548, 0.15142911, 0.31274073, 0.88143116, 0.97~\n$ p0    <dbl> 0.04319535, 0.03507396, 0.04166872, 0.06745600, 0.03933915, 0.03~\n$ p1    <dbl> 0.05225914, 0.04250932, 0.05042906, 0.08117855, 0.04763407, 0.04~\n$ y0    <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0~\n$ y1    <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0~\n$ y     <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, F~\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_y0 <- mean(fake_data$y0)\nmean_y1 <- mean(fake_data$y1)\nimpact <- round((mean(fake_data$y1) - mean(fake_data$y0)) * 100, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this fabricated dataset, we've engineered a scenario where, without\nintervention, only 4% would have adopted the feature.\nYet, with the intervention applied universally, adoption would have jumped to\n5%.

The distance\nbetween \"dissatisfied\" and \"neutral\" may not be the same as that between\n\"satisfied\" and \"very satisfied.\" This lack of equal spacing is a challenge we\nmust address head-on when analyzing the impact of an intervention or treatment.\n\nThis nuance of ordinal outcomes is also present in other domains, such as user\nexperience ratings (e.g., poor, fair, good, excellent), or educational\nattainment levels (e.g., less than high school, high school diploma, some\ncollege, college degree). In each case, there's a clear order, but the spacing\nbetween levels is not uniform.\n\nThis lack of uniform spacing can complicate our analysis, particularly when\napplying traditional regression models designed for continuous outcomes. We need\na tailored approach that respects the ordinal nature of the data, while still\nallowing us to draw meaningful causal inferences.\n\nTODO\n\n## Count Outcomes\n\nIn this section, we're talking about events we can tally—website visits,\ncustomer complaints, product sales, you name it. These outcomes are inherently\nnon-negative integers, reflecting the discrete nature of the events we're\ncounting.\n\nThe go-to tool for analyzing count outcomes is often Poisson regression.\nHowever, real-world data frequently throws us a curveball in the form of\noverdispersion, where the variance of the count data outstrips its mean. This is\nwhere negative binomial regression swoops in to save the day. It's a souped-up\nversion of Poisson regression that accounts for overdispersion by adding an\nextra parameter to the model.\n\nCount data pops up in all sorts of scenarios. We might be interested in the\neffect of a new marketing campaign on app downloads or the impact of a software\nupdate on user logins. With count outcomes, the possibilities are as endless as\nthe events we can count.\n\n### An Example with Fake Data: Video Views Galore\n\nLet's say we're interested in the number of views a video receives in a given\nperiod. This is a perfect opportunity to use the negative binomial distribution\nto model the underlying data-generating process. Here's how we can express this:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i  & \\sim \\text{NB}(\\mu_i, \\phi) \\\\\nlog(\\mu_i)  & = \\alpha + X\\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this model, $\\mu$ represents the mean (which must be positive, hence the log\nlink function), and the inverse of $\\phi$ controls the overdispersion. A small\n$\\phi$ means the negative binomial distribution significantly deviates from a\nPoisson distribution, while a large $\\phi$ brings it closer to a Poisson. This\nbecomes clear when we look at the variance:\n\n\n$$\nVar(y_i)  \\sim \\mu_i + \\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\phi}\n$$\n\nLet's whip up some fake data to illustrate:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(9782)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nN <- 1000\n\nfake_data <-\n  tibble::tibble(x1 = runif(N, 2, 9), x2 = rnorm(N, 0, 1)) %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    mu = exp(0.5 + 1.7 * x1 + 4.2 * x2),\n    y0 = rnbinom(N, size = 2, mu = mu), # here size is phi\n    y1 = y0 * 1.05,\n    t = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = n(), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5)),\n    y = case_when(t ~ as.integer(y1),\n      .default = as.integer(y0)\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  filter(y > 0)\n\n# Plotting the histogram using ggplot2\nggplot(fake_data, aes(x = y)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 100,\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~t) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of y\", x = \"y\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  xlim(0, 1e4) +\n  ylim(0, 20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](beyond_normality_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### OLS: A Common, But Flawed, Approach\n\nA typical way to estimate the lift of an intervention in this scenario is to run\nordinary least squares (OLS) on the natural logarithm of the outcome.

But what if we want to know\nthe probability that the impact is at least 1% (or any other threshold)? Easy\npeasy! We use `nb$posteriorProb(threshold = 0.01)`\n(Given the data, we estimate that the probability that the effect is more than 0.01 is 93%.).
