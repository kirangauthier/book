## The Basic Idea {#sec-potential}

<img src="img/potential.jpg" align="right" height="280" alt="The Potential Outcomes Framework" />

The potential outcomes framework, also known as the Rubin Causal Model, provides
a formal mathematical approach to defining and estimating causal effects. This
framework, developed by Donald Rubin building on work by Jerzy Neyman, is
central to modern causal inference and has become increasingly important in
business data science. At its core, the potential outcomes framework posits that
each unit (e.g., person, company, product) has a set of potential outcomes$\kgnote{, Y}$
corresponding to each possible treatment condition$\kgnote{, T}$. $\kgnote{In many settings, the treatment has two distinct possibilites, a unit is either treated, } {T=1} \kgnote{or untreated, } {T=0} {. Often, units who are treated are identified to be part of the "treatment group", whereas units who are untreated are part of the "control". The shorthand } $Y(1)$ { abbreviates the clearer, but more visually busy } $Y(T=1)$ \kgnote{which can be read as "the potential outcome for units in the treated group". The same can be said for } $Y(T=0)$ \kgnote{ which is the potential outcome for the control, or untreated, group.} $\sout{For instance:}$ $\kgnote{Some common examples might be:}$ 

1. A tech company testing a new app interface might consider:
    - $Y(1)$: user engagement if exposed to the $\kgnote{add bolds} \textbf{new}$ interface 
    - $Y(0)$: user engagement if exposed to the $\textbf{old}$ interface
2. An e-commerce platform implementing a recommendation system might examine:
    - $Y(1)$: customer purchase amount $\textbf{with}$ personalized recommendations
    - $Y(0)$: customer purchase amount $\textbf{without}$ personalized recommendations
3. A SaaS company offering a free trial could look at:
    - $Y(1)$: conversion rate if $\textbf{offered}$ a 30-day free trial 
    - $Y(0)$: conversion rate if $\textbf{not offered}$ a free trial

The causal effect for an individual is then defined as the difference between
these potential outcomes: $Y(1) - Y(0)$. However, we face what
@holland1986statistics termed the "fundamental problem of causal inference" - we
can only observe one of these potential outcomes for each unit. If a customer is
exposed to the new interface, we observe $Y(1)$ but $Y(0)$ remains unobserved
(and vice versa). $\kgnote{if you liked the 2 universes, we can add it here and restructure this}$ This makes causal inference inherently a missing data problem,
a concept we'll explore further later in this chapter.

## Key Concepts and Estimands

Several important concepts and estimands are central to the potential outcomes
framework. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the average causal effect
across the entire population, defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. $\kgnote{Coming back to our example about monitoring the time spent on our app after releasing the new feature, the ATE is our estimate of the average change in watch time across all app users, which } \sout{This} gives us an
overall measure of the treatment's impact. 

\kgnote{Importantly, the ATE can often be diluted, for the moment, suppose there are only two groups of users for our app. The first group is composed of users for whom the new feature makes absolutely no difference for, the expected difference in their potential outcomes is close to zero, because they don't care about the feature, $\mathbb{E}[Y(1 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care}) - Y(0 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care})] \approx 0$. Aside: Remember that expectations, $\mathbb{E}(x) = \sum_N x p(x)$ are just mathematical expressions which help us recover the mean, so $\mathbb{E}[Y(1 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care}) - Y(0 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care})] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_N Y(1 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care}) - Y(0 \mid \text{group}_\text{don't care}) \approx 0$. For the other group, who love the feature, the amount of time spent on the app increases meaningfully, $\mathbb{E}[Y(1 \mid \text{group})_\text{care}) - Y(0 \mid \text{group}_\text{care})] \gt 0$. The ATE is a weighted average of the potential outcomes of both groups, where the weights are the proportion of users in each group. As the number of users in the first group outweighs the number of users in the second group, the ATE is pulled towards zero, and the business might decide to not launch the feature because it seemingly has little effect, even though a small, but important group of users loved the new feature.} 

$\sout{When we're interested} \kgnote{Being aware of the possibility that different subgroups may experience meaningfully different treatment effects, and that we might care to understand them is the first step in addressing the limitations of the ATE. As we had said, the ATE is a weighted average of smaller subgroups treatment effects, where the weights are the proportion of units in any group. When we estimate the ATE for any given subgroup, we're interested in the}$ Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). This is
defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X]$, where X represents a specific set of
covariates$\kgnote{, features, or more generally *contexts*, that our units can fall into / be described by. We've seen the CATE before, when we discussed the two groups above, $\text{group}_\text{don't care}$ and $\text{group}_\text{care}$, we were estimating the CATE for each group, and adding them to recover the ATE. The}$ CATE allows us to understand how the treatment effect might differ
for various segments of our population.

$\kgnote{There is, however, no free lunch, estimating the CATE comes at the cost of splitting our initial sample of units into distinct subgroups, by defintion. We'll introduce this thought here, and expand on it in Chapters XX and YY, but our ability to estimate an uncertain quantity, like a treatment effect, is inversely related to the sample size in the group. This can also be phrased in terms of the `r glossary("bias-variance tradeoff", "Bias-variance tradeoff")`. Being ignorant to the subgroups, and estimating the population effect through the ATE, we'll arrive at a confident estimate of the magnitude of the treatment (low-variance), but we'll struggle to reconcile the ATE with the treatment effect for any subgroup (high-bias). Acknowledging the presence of the subgroups, and estimating the treatment effects in each of these contexts, we'll be less confident in the treatment effect for any subgroup (high-variance), but we'll be able to distinguish the treatment effect associated with any given group (low-bias). Later, in Chapter XX, we'll discuss how the estimates from these subgroups can be adaptively pooled using hierarchical models, and how this helps both stabilize our estimates, and explicitly model the heterogeneity observed between subgroups.} 

Sometimes, $\kgnote{our treatment assignment doesn't reflect the subgroup of units which actually were treated. For example, say we push the new feature to the app, but some fraction of users in the treated group don't log into the app during our experiment. Although they were part of the treatment group, $T=1$, they were not treated, this is \sout{we're particularly interested in the effect on those who actually
received the treatment. This}$ is captured by the Average Treatment Effect on the
Treated (ATT), defined as $E[Y(1) - Y(0) | W = 1]$, where W is the treatment
indicator. In certain scenarios, such as when using instrumental variables $\kgnote{(Chapter XX)}$, we
might focus on the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), which represents the
average treatment effect for a specific subpopulation of compliers.

A crucial assumption in many causal analyses is **ignorability**. This assumes
that treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes given
observed covariates$\kgnote{, or that, conditional on the observed covariates, the treatment assignment is as good as random}$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
$(Y(1), Y(0)) ‚ä• W | X$ where $W$ is the treatment assignment and $X$ are the
observed covariates. For instance, in our e-commerce recommendation system
example, ignorability would mean that whether a customer sees personalized
recommendations (W) is independent of how much they would potentially purchase
with or without recommendations ($Y(1), Y(0)$), once we account for observed
factors like browsing history, past purchases, etc. ($X$).

## Experimental vs Observational Studies

The potential outcomes framework can be applied to both experimental and
observational studies, each with its own strengths and challenges:

**Experimental Studies:** In randomized controlled trials, treatment assignment
is controlled by the researcher. This control ensures that the ignorability
assumption holds by design. For example, when A/B testing a new website design,
the randomization of which users see which version ensures that potential
outcomes are independent of the assignment. This makes $\sout{causal inference} \kgnote{the estimation of the treatment effect associated with users seeing the new website design}$ more
straightforward but may not always be feasible in business settings due to
ethical, practical, or cost constraints.

**Observational Studies:** These are more common in business contexts but
present more challenges. For instance, if we want to study the effect of a
loyalty program on customer retention, customers typically choose whether to
join the program rather than being randomly assigned. In these cases, we need to
carefully consider and account for potential confounders to approximate the
conditions of an experiment. This often involves sophisticated statistical
techniques to adjust for $\kgnote{inherent}$ differences between the treatment and control groups,
such as propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting $\kgnote{which adjust for the non-randomness of the treatment assingment by estimating the probability that the unit (regardless of whether they were treated or not) received the treatment they did}$. 

## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

In business applications, it's crucial to consider that the effect of an
intervention might vary across different subgroups of customers or products.
This heterogeneity can be masked when looking only at average effects. For
example:

  - A new marketing strategy might have a positive effect on one customer
    segment but a negative effect on another.
  - A product feature might significantly boost engagement for power users but
    have minimal impact on casual users.

$\kgnote{I didn't see this section and wrote it above, but can just move it down here}$ 


$\kgnote{I think we can add to this, I'm a huge proponent of understanding and **appreciating** heterogeneity.} Understanding these heterogeneous effects can lead to more targeted and
effective business strategies, such as personalized marketing campaigns or
tailored product features.

## Selection Bias

Selection bias occurs when the individuals who select into the treatment group
differ systematically from those who do not. In business contexts, this is a
common issue. For example:

  - Customers who choose to use a new feature might be systematically different
    from those who don't, making it challenging to isolate the true effect of
    the feature on outcomes like engagement or sales.
  - Early adopters of a product might have different characteristics and
    behaviors compared to later adopters, potentially skewing our understanding
    of the product's impact.

Recognizing and addressing selection bias is crucial for making valid causal
inferences in business settings $\kgnote{as well as communicating these different contexts to our model, ... this is probably a good point to mention exchangeability & ignorance, or mention it again ...}$. 

## Connections to Missing Data

The link between causal inference and missing data is profound. In the potential
outcomes framework, we're always missing at least one potential outcome for each
unit. This is similar to the problem of missing data in surveys or experiments
where some values are unobserved$\sout{.} \kgnote{and more generally shares a deep connection with Bayesian statistics where there is no hard boundary between observed data $Y$, and unknown, or latent parameters, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. ... parameters as random variables rather than fixed? ... Bishop "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" -- latent variables as "hidden" data? ... the symmetry of the joint, Bayes' theorem $p(\boldsymbol{\theta} \mid Y)$ and $p(Y \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})$ ... not sure how much you want to get into it here}

Methods developed for handling missing data have direct analogues in causal
inference. For example, multiple imputation techniques can be adapted to impute
missing potential outcomes. Inverse probability weighting, commonly used in
missing data problems, is analogous to propensity score weighting in causal
inference.

The assumptions underlying missing data methods also have parallels in causal
inference. The assumption of "Missing At Random" (MAR) in missing data
literature is similar to the ignorability assumption in causal inference. Both
assume that the missingness (or treatment assignment) is independent of the
unobserved data, given the observed data.

Understanding these connections can provide valuable insights and tools for
addressing the inherent missing data problem in causal inference. By leveraging
techniques from both fields, researchers can develop more robust methods for
estimating causal effects in a variety of real-world scenarios$\sout{.} \kgnote{and refining their insights as they learn more about the nature of the system under study.}$ 

## Conclusion

The potential outcomes framework provides a powerful tool for business data
scientists to approach causal questions rigorously. By understanding the
fundamental concepts, key estimands, and challenges associated with this
framework, data scientists can make more informed decisions about experimental
design, analysis methods, and interpretation of results. As we delve deeper into
specific techniques and applications in the following chapters, keep these
foundational ideas in mind ‚Äì they will serve as the bedrock for more advanced
causal inference methods in business contexts.
