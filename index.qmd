# About this book

In the modern business landscape, data isn't just an asset â€“ it's the raw
material from which informed decisions are forged. Data, however, does not speak
for itself. The extraction of actionable insights requires not only technical
prowess, but a sophisticated understanding of $\sout{causal inference}$ $\kgcol{the nature of causality and the data generating process}$. This is where
the business data scientist steps in, acting as the voice of data, translating
its complex signals into $\sout{meaningful}$ $\kgcol{compelling / cohesive}$ narratives that drive strategic
decision-making. The field is particularly well-suited for those with a
background in economics, as economists generally possess the analytical skills,
statistical training, and problem-solving mindset essential to $\sout{excel in this
role}$ $\kgcol{derive meaningful insights, and iteratively refine the models, and conclusions given noisy, and often incomplete, data}$.

However, it's important to note that this does not mean all economists will
automatically make good business data scientists, nor that only economists are
suited for this career. Other academic backgrounds that can prepare you well for
this field include statistics, biostatistics, computer science, and even certain
areas of psychology or sociology that emphasize quantitative methods. The key is
to remember that technical knowledge alone is not sufficient. A successful
business data scientist must be able to engage effectively with stakeholders,
understand the decisions they're grappling with, help frame business questions
that can be answered with data, and communicate findings in a clear, actionable
manner.

This book is your compass in the dynamic world of business data science,
designed for those aspiring to not just analyze data, but to truly understand
and influence the underlying causes and effects within a business context. The
business data scientist is a unique breed, blending the rigor of a statistician
with the acumen of a strategist. They are experts in applying an analytical lens
to business problems, leveraging techniques from causal inference, advanced
statistical modeling, and forecasting $\kgcol{add experimental design here?}$. They possess the ability to discern the
optimal approach for a given problem, communicating complex findings clearly to
both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

While proficient in data extraction from large datasets (e.g., using SQL), what
truly sets these professionals apart is a deep-seated understanding of the
assumptions underpinning their chosen methods, allowing them to critically
evaluate results and avoid blind reliance on off-the-shelf tools. $\kgnote{We caution that if one does not truly understand the internal machinations of a given method, one becomes a slave to their warped view of the world. In the past, these models were a necessary evil due to the complexities of fitting more flexible models, however, due to the efforts of the open-source community, languages like }$ `[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)`, `[PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html)`, and `[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)` $\kgnote{are a huge step forward in challenging the assumptions of conventional models, and more faithfully reproducing the data generating process.}$ $\kgnote{this doesn't flow well anymore, lmk if you want me to move}$ Furthermore,
they are adaptable problem-solvers, capable of implementing advanced
methodologies from scratch or even designing entirely novel approaches when
faced with unconventional challenges.

Throughout this book, we'll navigate the core principles of causal inference,
learning how to confidently identify cause-and-effect relationships within data $\kgnote{, and how these relationships are themselves testable assumptions for future models}.
We'll delve into the critical role of experimental design, covering randomized
controlled trials, from simple A/B tests to Bayesian adaptive designs $\kgnote{as a tool to isolate the impact of our interventions}$. We'll
also explore observational methods for when experiments are not possible,
elucidating how to analyze their outcomes to reach valid conclusions $\kgnote{, and most importantly, communicating the limitations associated with them to avoid an overzealous interpretation of their results}$. Our focus
will be on techniques to mitigate inherent biases and draw meaningful insights
from non-experimental data.

Our exploration will emphasize a "decisions first" philosophy. This approach
prioritizes a clear articulation of the business problem at hand, ensuring data
analysis is always laser-focused on informing and optimizing decision-making. To
ground these concepts in reality, we'll provide practical examples and case
studies spanning diverse industries, showcasing how data science can be wielded
to address tangible business challenges.

To facilitate your learning journey, we'll incorporate code examples. These
examples will illuminate the technical aspects of data analysis, empowering you
to apply them to your own projects. Additionally, each chapter includes links to
relevant academic papers and further resources, allowing you to dive deeper into
any topic that piques your interest or demands more thorough exploration for
your specific needs.

By the book's conclusion, you'll possess a basic foundation in business data
science and the confidence to leverage data as a driving force for
decision-making within your organization. Let's embark on this illuminating
journey together, unlocking the power of data to propel your business success.

$\kgnote{This needs to be fleshed out, but I got the idea from Thomas and wanted to talk about it here. In many business settings, stakeholders will be unwilling to randomize... implications around not being able to learn about that group. OR In many settings, the cost of excluding some individuals from an eligible population comes at a cost to the business, the cost of this lost revenue, for example, can be weighed against the reduction of uncertainty of knowing something about the group. We suggest that the true cost of the data is then **the cost changing one decision**. something like that, Thomas had mentioned it to me when he was in the city and I liked it. could also got the route of "consider that the worst outcome is an inconclusive result" or something along those lines. }

In its current state, I would not call this a book. At best, it represents the
draft of an idea for the first draft of a book. As such, there are many elements
missing, and likely several errors.
